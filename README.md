## Best Practices
- It is recommended that you:
  - include a display name on your YAML pipeline steps to increase visibility and understanding of what is happening
  - not use Classic Build or Classic Release pipelines as they do not scale easily


## To Do
- add logic to infrastructure pre-processing to run pwsh if .ps1 or bash if .sh
- add enum for file extension for each infrastructure language
